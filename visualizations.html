	    <p>Out of 3,118 ITS engagements:
	      <ul><li>Campus News: 47.2%</li>
	        <li>Safe Computing: 26.2%</li>

      <p>We most often post between <em>noon and 10PM</em>. As a result, those are the times the most engaged with tweets fall into - specifically between <em>12PM and 8PM</em>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> I don't have data regarding <em>when</em> the engagements occured, only what time the posts with most engagements were made.</p>

	    <p>Nothing surprising, but engagement with the #MichiganIT hashtag has increased annually. I suspect that it is due to the increase in number of tweets which use the hashtag.</p>
